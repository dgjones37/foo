--------------
HOW MUCH IS A VET CHECKUP FOR A DOG?

There are four basic types of vet checkups for dogs: office calls, vaccine boosters, heartworm tests, and fecal exams. Each of these types of checkups have varying costs (depending on your location, specific vet, dog breed, etc.).

Office Calls: $45-$55
Vaccine Boosters: $18-$25
Heartworm Tests: $45-$50
Fecal Exams: $25-$45

BASIC COSTS

Once your dog or cat is into adulthood, these are the basic services that every pet parent should expect to pay for at the annual vet visit.

Office Call: This is the cost of the appointment and physical examination, and can vary widely depending on your geographic location and the veterinarian, or clinic, that you choose. The average cost is $45-$55.

Vaccine Boosters: Vaccine boosters are shots administered after the initial dose to keep the vaccine effective. Some of your pet’s vaccinations may require boosters while others may not, but most pets require 2-4 boosters each year. The average cost for booster shots ranges between $18-$25.

Heartworm Test: This annual test checks for heartworm disease, which is a serious and potentially deadly condition caused by parasitic worms. Blood testing for this disease generally costs $45-$50.

Fecal Exam: Fecal exams are performed to identify gastrointestinal parasites, and the importance of this testing as part of the annual check-up has grown in recent years. The average cost falls somewhere around $25-$45.
